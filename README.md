## Abstract

In this workshop we aim to implement an image-based analysis of a biological system by profiling the phenotipic response of a cancer cell line following perturbation with a small-molecule compound library by using [Advanced Cell Classifier](https://www.cellclassifier.org/), an interactive tool designed to analyse high-throughput experiments on single cell level.

## Software Installation

All the following softwares are recommended to be installed by the time of the training.
